		<h1>Ally Accessibility Office Hours Scheduling</h1>
<h4>Make sure to include the following in your appointment notes:</h4>
<li>What is the name of the project and what LOB?</li>
<li>What type of question do you have? (design, content, dev, testing)</li>
<li>What is the gemini ticket, jira ticket or confluence link?</li>
<li>Do other teammates need the invite? If so, who?</li>
<p><em>Please try to schedule the earliest available time. Also, please share the time you scheduled with any teammates who need to be included. We will post the schedule on the #ux-accessibility slack channel, and please use the zoom in the standing accessibility office hours invite to join at the time you scheduled.</em><br/>(You don't have to put in a real phone number, but you can if you want a text notification reminding you of your booked time.)</p>
